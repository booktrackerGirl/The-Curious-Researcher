Social data is defined as the publicly available information which is collected from usersâ€™ public online activity on social media networks, consisting of information such as their location, language, and content shared. Examples of such data would include images, text, location, biographical data, as well as shared and reposted links. Information created by the platform users could also form a part of such data, such as blogtagging, online game playing, photo tagging and instant messenger.
